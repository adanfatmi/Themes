# Themes
The Dynamic Theme Switcher project allows users to choose from three themes (Dark, Light, and Calm) using CSS and JavaScript. It features smooth theme transitions, remembers user preferences, and ensures accessibility. The use of CSS variables enhances customization, while the project maintains a responsive design for a seamless user experience across devices.
